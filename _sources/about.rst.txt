About Keri Sime
============================

I have a background in pure mathematics, accounting and international business. After working briefly as a data analyst in the financial sector, I spent 5+ years working in shipping and international purchasing. In 2018, I was awarded an engineering masterâ€™s degree in applied mathematics and computer science. I have subsequently worked on advanced analytics projects in the marketing space where I use my business acumen and analytical skills to aid in decision-making.
